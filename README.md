The Flutter Multiplatform Plugin is written as a [Federated Flutter Plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#federated-plugins). Each platform supported by the plugin wraps a native artifiact for the corresponding platform, compiled by the SDK library. The bulk of the code in this package is generated by the Code Generator project

### Platform Interface

The package **kangaroo_app_sdk_platform_interface** is a dart package which exposes a set interfaces that are implemented in the native platform code. There is one interface per "feature". This package is not exposed to developers and is used for internal communication between flutter and the native platform code.

### App Facing Package

The package **kangaeroo_app_sdk** is the actual package that developers will import into their projects. This package bridges the gap between the platform_interface code and flutter apps. This package has a single Api class per feature. Much like the native SDK artifacts, each Api class exposes a single function to call the api, as well as a Stream which can be observed for data updates.

### Platform Specific Packages

The packages kangaroo_app_sdk_android, kangaroo_app_sdk_ios, and kangaroo_app_sdk_web contain native code for the relavent platforms. Each of these packages imports the relavent native artifact created by the Multiplatform Library. For each feature in the SDK, a **Plugin Handler** class exists which registers the class with the Flutter engine, as well as bridges communication between Flutter and the Multiplatform Library.
